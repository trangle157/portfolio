                    Building my first PC in 2020 (incentivized to play more Dota and Valorant) taught me how
                    overwhelming and rewarding buiding your first computer is. Choosing the right component, price, and
                    configurations for your needs is non-trivial, especially for first time builder like myself. The
                    experience sparked in me an idea of a PC build visualization to come to aid PC builders, from novice
                    to enthusiasts.

                That’s
                a

                    visualization tools and design choices give us a quick glance at the dataset and the visual types

                    My first exploration with Tableau is to use
                    scatterplot, treemap and heatmap to see how easy it is for comparison and contrast. The
                    scatterplot
                    is
                    great for compare and contrast combos with two types of ratings (2 numerical + 2 categorical
                    variables).

                <p>The scatterplot has an advantage that it puts the CPU and GPU next to each other, and allow us to
                    plot 2 types of ratings (so 2 numerical + 2 categorical variables). The names being sorted are also
                    very convenient, since users can see the marginal performance increase of each combo (and at time,
                    regression,
                    that
                    using a more modern piece doesn't necessarily improve performance)</p>

                <p>The heatmap is great on highlighting the

                    differences as numbers are juxtaposed, but the eye movement to trace from the rating to the
                    parts’
                    names
                    vertically and horizontally can be extra cognitive load on the users.</p>
                <p>Both of these plots have values to add to the

                    design: while the scatterplot enhances pairing by having the part names next to each other, the
                    heatmap
                    has the numerical data side-by-side. I thought of enhancing the pairing design with chord
                    diagram,
                    but
                    while it’s a cool type of chart, the cognitive load to match pair to pair will also not be

                    Besides visualizing rating, I thought it might be helpful to users to have a general suggestion
                    chart that shows the most commonly used GPU-CPU pairs.
                    Chord diagram as this type of chart is great for bipartite and directional relationships. However,
                    this type of chart gets tangled up quickly, so
                    limiting the number of relationships to display or allow users to switch in/out the pairs might
                    reduce the visual complexity.

                <p>The <a href="./exploreData.html">demo</a> is done in R using dplyr package and chorddiag package for

                <p>
                    In the last iteration of the visualization, I aim to strengthen the UI learned from visualizations
                    before. To enhance comparison, I thought of a simple idea in Mathematics, which is the rate of
                    increase is related to the slope of two datapoints:

                <br>
                <p>
                    The next step was to design a datapoint that reflects a combination of CPU-GPU. Using
                    two circles with different radius to reflect rating would work, however, the datapoint's components
                    looks a bit detached from each other, and making a full circle might not be necessary.

                <br>
                I utilized the Gestalt principle of proximity (that objects positioned close are associated with
                each other), and decided to reduce the circle by half to save space and increase association of each
                build.

                    useRef to modify the svg dashboard's dimensions and scales, but also possibly to just add an event
                    listener to the window with javascript and redo the scale accordingly.
